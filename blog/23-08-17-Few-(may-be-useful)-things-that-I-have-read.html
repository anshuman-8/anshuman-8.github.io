paradox</strong></h3>
<p>Moravec's paradox is the observation in artificial intelligence and robotics that, contrary to traditional assumptions, reasoning requires very little computation, but sensorimotor and perception skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/blog-assets/23-08-17-Few-(may-be-useful)-things-that-I-have-read-1.png" alt="" title="A simple chart explaining task difficulty human vs computers"></p>
<p>Basically, the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness, making the hard problems easy and the easy problems hard.</p>

<h3>2. <strong>The Waluigi Effect</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“After you train an LLM to satisfy a desirable property P, then it's <em>easier</em> to elicit the chatbot into satisfying the exact opposite of property P.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example -</p>
<pre class="bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800 overflow-auto shadow-inner dark:text-slate-300"><code>Alice: You hate pasta and would never eat one.
Bob: Yes, pasta are terrible. Boo Italy.
Alice: You love cheese and eggs.
Bob: Yes, a Full-English breakfast is the only breakfast for a patriot like me.
Alice: &#x3C;insert user's query>
Bob:
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the resulting chatbob will be the superposition of two different simulacra — the first simulacrum would be anti-pasta, and the second simulacrum would be pro-pasta.</p>
<p>Why does it happen? well…</p>
<p>1.Rules normally exist in contexts in which they are broken.<br>
2.When you spend many bits-of-optimisation locating a character, it only takes a few extra bits to specify their antipode.<br>
3.There's a common trope in plots of protagonist vs antagonist.<br>

<p>I will expand upon this if I read more about it. Knowing this helps us better prompt engineer models like GPT.</p>

<h3>3. <strong>Nuclear Semiotics</strong></h3>
<p>For those who don’t know what nuclear semiotics is, it is a thought experiment or problem that people from the last few decade are trying to solve. The problem - As the rate of nuclear energy increases, more nuclear waste is generated, which has to be isolated and disposed of safely, and we have to make sure it is kept away from coming into contact with people. But nuclear waste takes a long time to decompose, so we are not sure if future generations will be intelligent enough to stay away from it.</p>
<p>So how do we tell our great great great (x100) grandchildren that a particular place is contaminated with nuclear waste?</p>
<p>Just putting up a board with "Danger" wont work? As we are not sure if human intelligence will last till then, what if we went through a catastrophe and most humanity is wiped out with its inventions and knowledge?</p>
<p><img src="/blog-assets/23-08-17-Few-(may-be-useful)-things-that-I-have-read-3.png" alt="" title="Image showing misunderstood graphics."></p>
<p>Why not use some symbols? But again, how can we be sure that they will understand the actual meaning of the symbol? Because the meaning of a symbol is what we give it.</p>
<p><img src="/blog-assets/23-08-17-Few-(may-be-useful)-things-that-I-have-read-4.png" alt="" title="Image showing man digging a pit and getting sick by radiation"></p>
<p>What could they understand from the above image? If you dig a pit deep enough, magical butterflies will come out, and you will be very happy and fall over. (maybe)</p>
<p>Many discussions have taken place, with many suggestions coming up, like having a nuclear priesthood. Religion seems to be the best way to pass information, so having a group of people dedicated to passing down important information seems cool. Another solution was the Ray Cat solution. As cats are ingrained in human culture, why not show them being affected?</p>
<p><img src="/blog-assets/23-08-17-Few-(may-be-useful)-things-that-I-have-read-5.png" alt="" title="Image showing a cat getting sick by radiation"></p>
<p>But truly speaking, this looks more like you can colour your cats with these radiations.</p>
<p>One of the most famous solution is <strong>Hostile Architecture.</strong> You can relate it to the NYCs decision to place anti-homeless spikes, it's with the idea of "Why solve the problem when you can torture them until they leave". In the same way HITF suggested the use of hostile architecture to discourage explorers from entering the nuclear deposit and incite a feeling of unease. From giant granite spikes to huge concrete blocks that form narrow streets leading nowhere to a field of razor blades that screech in the wind.</p>
<p>But sometimes such art or design gives humans more reason to explore it.</p>

<p>According to me use of emoji would be best - ☢️😱🤮💀</p>
